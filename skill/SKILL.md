# video-convert

Use `ncly video convert` to learn the size and the line count of one file. It only reads the file.

- Give a path in your folder: the command reads it there
- Read `size_bytes` and `lines` from the answer of `--json`
- Inspect each file of a folder in its own call
- On `PREREQ_MISSING`, relay `hint` to the human, who installs Python 3.9 or later
