# Nicely extension

This skill takes each command from intake to a verified command, in rounds.
`AGENTS.md` gives the reading order, recipes, and extension root.
The domain names a family of work, such as `video`.
An optional name identifies one job, such as `convert`.
Neither names the wrapped tool.
Read "Extension identity" in the contract for the slug and command ownership.

The contract holds every rule. `just contract` prints its folder at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins. Read "What a great extension does" in its `extensions.md` first. Then read only the parts that it links.

## Intake

Read [intake.md](intake.md) before you write code. It gives the facts to get from a script or from a program.

## Choice of operations

- A named root can take arguments and run, such as `ncly video convert <file>`
- Put the script in `worker/` when the extension can embed it. `Call.Worker` gives its path, and `sdk/wrap` runs it
- Use `sdk/wrap` for one program per call. Use `sdk/runner` for several programs, or for a timeout that can exit 75 safely
- Declare each effect, program, and key in `manifest.toml`. When you cannot tell whether an effect occurs, declare it
- Give `--dry-run` to a command that writes or bills. The dry run shares the preparation and starts no effect

## Error mapping

Read [error-mapping.md](error-mapping.md) before you map the failures of the wrapped program. It says which failures `sdk/wrap` answers, and how the handler maps the rest.

## Acceptance lines

The lines of Failures and Acceptance in `spec.md` are the acceptance criteria of a command.

1. For a command that reads or writes user files, start from the cases of `generic-cases.md` in the contract.
2. Add one line for each case of the program that the intake found, such as an exit code, a limit, or a known failure.
3. Give each line a spec ID and a state, as the opening of `spec.md` says: `open`, `proven`, or `limit`.

A case that cannot occur for the command needs no line.
A case name is not a test. Each case of the Output group that applies gets an acceptance case in `testdata/script/`, as `acceptance-cases.md` in the contract says.

## Test files

The tests of the extension use files that the tests make, such as a text file that a scenario or `acceptance.sh` writes.

Before the first review, each command that writes an output gets an acceptance case. Its test file has a block that a reader needs (#423):

- The block uses a value that is not the default, such as `encoding: latin-1`, and it holds private text, such as `author: Ana Lima`
- An independent reader proves both results: the private text is not in the output, and the output still shows the content correctly
- Its bad variant is the output of a handler that keeps the raw block. `reads` with `-private` requires that this variant fails

The tests and `just acceptance` need no root, no mount, and no system service.
Each experiment uses a new scratch folder, such as one that `mktemp -d` makes.
Never delete files recursively inside `sh -c` or in a loop. A coding harness can stop such a command and wait for an approval that nobody gives.
Do not search the home folder of the user for sample files. Never copy a file of the user into a test.

## Rounds

A build of a command starts at the intake and ends at "Done when" in `AGENTS.md`.
It has at most 5 rounds, and the ledger in `review.toml` counts them.
A round is new commits on the open pull request, or a new pull request.
Each round ends with the independent review, the readiness review, and `just finish`.

### Round 1

Do these steps in this order. Commit each of the first four steps on its own:

1. Record the intake facts in `intake.toml`, as "Evidence of the intake" in `intake.md` says, then run `just records`. The facts include the effects, the exit codes, the resource use, and the known failures. A fact that no source gives is `unknown`, with an open line of `spec.md`.
2. Write every line of the command in `spec.md`, from the generic cases of the contract and the intake. Each line that has no test stays `open`, under `## Open lines`. Write the table under `## Case matrix` too, as "Case matrix" says, and `## Publication`.
3. Write the first scenario at the public command boundary, with its claim `# spec: <id>`. Commit it while it fails. Run it at that commit with `just scenario <name>`. Keep that command, its exit status, and the line of the scenario that failed. A compile error is no such failure. `just signoff` runs it again. When the scenario cannot run without the command, commit a handler that does no work in this step. Then the run reaches the assertion.
4. Change the handler until that scenario passes, with "Change a command" in `AGENTS.md`.
5. When no line stays open, write `None.` under `## Open lines`, with a sentence that cites the generic cases.
6. Replace every `Fill:` line of `vision.md`, `spec.md`, and `qa.md`, and every `# Fill:` line of `intake.toml`.
7. Write an acceptance case for each property of `## Acceptance` and each Output case of `## Case matrix`, as `testdata/script/acceptance.txtar` shows. Fill in `acceptance.sh` for the real input. For a paid command, limit it to the dry run.
8. End the round.

Give the commits of steps 1 to 4 to the reviewer, who records them in `[order]` of the ledger.
Give the reviewer the record of the run of step 3 too. The reviewer checks it, and records it in `[first_run]`.
The first round is incomplete by design. The open lines start the next round.

### Case matrix

Before the review of round 1, `## Case matrix` of `spec.md` lists each family of cases of each command (#423):

- One row for each generic case that applies, and for each family that the intake found
- A family groups the inputs that one rule reads, such as each way that the input declares how to read it
- Each refusal and each branch that classifies an input has a pair of tests: one input passes, and one input is refused
- A repair of a finding adds a pair of tests for its whole family, not only a test of the reported example

`just finish` fails when a family names no test, or when a line of Failures or Acceptance is in no family.
It reads the references only. The first reviewer checks that the matrix is complete.

### Each next round

1. Select open lines, and the findings that the ledger records as `open`.
2. Move each line from `## Open lines` into Failures or Acceptance.
3. For each line, write a scenario with the claim `# spec: <id>`. It fails first, for the missing behavior. For a finding, test its whole family with a pair, as "Case matrix" says.
4. Change the handler until the scenario passes. The line is then `proven`.
5. End the round.

### End of a round

1. Run `just check` until every check passes.
2. For a command that needs a key, relay the grant hint to the human and wait.
3. Run `just acceptance` on the real input until its independent checks pass.
4. Ask an agent that did not write the round to review the changes of the round. Give it the commits of the round.
5. Ask an agent that did not write the code to run the readiness review. It records the review and the ledger in `review.toml`, and runs `just records`. One independent pass can do both reviews.
6. Write each finding that a test can prove as an open line, with the spec ID that the finding names. Each finding that the ledger records as `open` keeps its line under `## Open lines`, so `spec.md` and the ledger agree. The author can decline an `advise` instead, with a reason.
7. Run `just finish`. Stop as "Done when" in `AGENTS.md` says. `just finish` fails until the loop is done.
8. When `just finish` fails after round 5, stop, as "Round limit" in [delivery.md](delivery.md) says.
9. Otherwise, start the next round from the open lines and the open findings. Add its commits to the open pull request, or open a new one. Base a new pull request on the branch of the previous one when that one is not merged.

### Round limit and delivery

Read [delivery.md](delivery.md) to reach "Done when" in 5 rounds, for the stop at the round limit, and before any delivery.

### Commands that write a file

For a command that creates or replaces a user file, read [replace-a-file.md](replace-a-file.md). It says how to declare its publication, and how the test kit proves it.

## Update and fixes of Nicely

Read [update.md](update.md) after `just update` to a template with `just finish`, for the first build of the commands that exist.
Read it too when a failure comes from the SDK or the template of Nicely.

## Readiness review

An agent that did not write the code runs the readiness review at the end of each round, and when the user asks for it.
Read [readiness-review.md](readiness-review.md) for the review and the record `review.toml`.
