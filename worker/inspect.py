"""inspect.py FILE prints the size and the line count of a file as JSON.

The output is one line, such as {"size_bytes": 12, "lines": 2}. The worker
reads the file as bytes, so any encoding works, and a last line without a
newline counts too. It uses the standard library only, and Go renders and
translates every word that a human sees.
