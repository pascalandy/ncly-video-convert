// Command export writes the sidecars of the extension into a folder: its
// manifest, catalogs, and skill, as extension.Export writes them. just install
// builds it in the same go build as ncly-video-convert, so the sidecars come
// from that build, never from the source tree. The import name ext never
// collides with the domain, such as fmt.
