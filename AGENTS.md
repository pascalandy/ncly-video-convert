# AGENTS.md

`ncly-video-convert` adds commands at `ncly video convert` and beneath it.
The domain names a family of work, such as `video`.
An optional name identifies one job, such as `convert`.
Neither names the wrapped tool.
Read `extension-identity.md` in the pinned contract for the slug and command ownership.

## Read, in this order

1. `vision.md`: the job of the extension, what it wraps, and what it refuses
2. `spec.md`, including `## Acceptance`: each command's success criteria, effects, and failures
3. `qa.md`: how a user accepts the extension, with the UAT protocol of Nicely
4. `manifest.toml`: the machine facts of each command, which `ncly describe video convert --json` shows once the extension is installed
5. The contract, at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins. `just contract` prints its folder. Start with "What a great extension does" in its `extensions.md`, and open only the parts that it links

## Change a command

1. Write the command's spec before its implementation.
2. Prepare the manifest, catalog, and placeholder handler until `extension.Check` passes.
3. Write a scenario that fails for the missing behavior.
4. Write the handler body, on `sdk/wrap` for one program, or on `sdk/runner` for more.
5. Teach when to use the command in `skill/SKILL.md`.

Give each command one bounded job beneath the extension root.
Never relay arbitrary arguments to a wrapped program.
The skill teaches when to use the command, rather than its implementation.
For a command with a dry run, tell the agent to dry-run the call first.

In `acceptance.sh`, judge the result with a tool other than the extension.
Use the real input and criteria of `## Acceptance`.
For a paid command, run only its dry run.

A wrapped script goes in `worker/`. To take in a script, or to review the extension when the user asks, use the skill in `.agents/skills/nicely-extension/`.

`sdk/wrap` keeps 1 MB of stdout, and answers `RUNTIME` once a program writes more. A program that prints its progress on stdout, such as an encoder, can pass that limit in a long run. When the decoder reads no stdout, set `DiscardStdout: true` in `wrap.Program`. When it reads stdout, set an `OutputLimit` that the longest run cannot pass. Prove it with a scenario whose stub prints more than 1 MB on stdout, then exits 0.

## Rule index

The linked checks enforce these rules.
The paragraphs above state the rules marked "Prose only".
`test-kit.md` in the pinned contract gives scenario syntax and spec IDs.

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Each running command executes in a scenario | [Kit executed calls][calls] |
| Call only through `ncly`, `ncly-video-convert`, `exits`, `signal`, or `refuses` | [Kit call forms][links] |
| Each manifest example runs | [Kit examples][examples] |
| Declare each own error and warning code, with its commands and modes | [`extension.Check`][declarations] |
| Observe each declared code in its scope, or supply an `untested` reason with an issue | [Kit code coverage][codes] |
| A dry run and run refuse the same preparation failure on the same input | [Kit `refuses`][refuses] |
| A signal case checks the exit, answer, and surviving files | [Kit `signal`][signal] |
| Publication proof matches the current code, model, probe, and tool pins | `TestPublicationRecord`; read [verifying-video-publication](.agents/skills/verifying-video-publication/SKILL.md) when these change |
| Template and SDK versions move together through `just update` | [Kit version link][links] |
| The skill names only declared commands | [Kit skill links][links] |
| Sign off through `just signoff` and release through `just release vX.Y.Z` | [Signoff receipt][signoff], [release receipt][release] |
| A copied recipe holds no script | [Core template test][template-test] |
| `acceptance.sh` judges with another tool | Prose only; [release runs acceptance][release] |
| One bounded job, no arbitrary argument relay; the skill teaches when | Prose only |
| Spec first; a scenario fails before the handler body exists | Prose only |

## Recipes

The recipes need Go, `just`, and `uv`, which runs the pinned Copier of `just update`.
Scenarios use shell stubs of HandBrakeCLI and ffmpeg.
A real conversion needs HandBrakeCLI on PATH.
It also needs ffmpeg unless `--no-normalize` is set or the input has no audio.
Signoff also needs Git and `gh` with the `gh-signoff` extension.

After Copier creates the repository, run `go mod tidy` once, which writes `go.sum` for the recipes. Then commit the repository with Git, since `just update` needs a clean Git tree. Run `lefthook install` once per clone, so `just check` runs before each push. GitHub runs it again for each push to `main` and each pull request.

- `just check`: every check. It runs `go mod tidy -diff`, `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `go test`, whose test kit installs the extension into scratch folders
- `just verify-publication`: bounded publication model, Linux signal probes, and negative controls; refreshes the record checked by `just check`
- `just signoff`: checks the committed SHA in a detached scratch worktree, writes a receipt outside the repository, and signs that exact SHA
- `just install`: installs the extension into Nicely's extensions folder, in place of its previous install
- `just uninstall`: removes that install, and keeps its keys and grants
- `just acceptance [fixture]`: runs `acceptance.sh`, which runs the command of `## Acceptance` as an agent would, in scratch folders. It works on a copy of the fixture, or on an input that it makes
- `just update <version>`: runs the target version's updater on a clean Git tree, with the template before the SDK
- `just contract`: prints the folder of the contract at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins

### Update an older repository

For a repository whose update recipe holds a script, run the target updater directly.
Replace VERSION with the target Nicely tag, such as `v0.24.0`:

```sh
go -C "$(go mod download -json github.com/pascalandy/nicely@VERSION | sed -n 's/^[[:space:]]*"Dir": "\(.*\)",$/\1/p')" run ./sdk/extensionrepo/cmd/extensionrepo update VERSION "$PWD"
```

The updater keeps your dependencies and reconciles Nicely's replacements in `go.mod`.
On a Copier conflict, resolve each file and mark it with `git add`.
Remove each `.rej` file, then run the printed bootstrap command with `--continue`.
This finishes dependency updates and runs `just check`.
"Update an extension" in `extension-repository.md` of the contract holds the recovery rules.

## Done when

`just check` passes, and `just acceptance` passes on the real input of `## Acceptance`.
For a command that needs a key, relay the grant hint to the human and wait.

## Release

1. Commit every change
2. Push that commit to a review branch
3. Run `just signoff` for that pushed commit
4. Make sure that "Done when" holds for this commit
5. Merge that exact signed SHA into the default branch
6. Run `just release vX.Y.Z`, with an optional fixture path
7. Read the printed receipt for acceptance, the published install, Economy reservations, hosted checks, and uninstall

For release recovery, read "Release and install" in the pinned contract's `extensions.md`.
