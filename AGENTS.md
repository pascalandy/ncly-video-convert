# AGENTS.md

`ncly-video-convert` adds commands at `ncly video convert` and beneath it.
The domain names a family of work, such as `video`.
An optional name identifies one job, such as `convert`.
Neither names the wrapped tool.
Read `extension-identity.md` in the pinned contract for the slug and command ownership.

## Read, in this order

1. `vision.md`: the job of the extension, what it wraps, and what it refuses
2. `spec.md`, including `## Acceptance`: each command's success criteria, effects, and failures
3. `qa.md`: how a user accepts the extension, with the UAT protocol of Nicely
4. `manifest.toml`: the machine facts of each command, which `ncly describe video convert --json` shows once the extension is installed
5. The contract, at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins. `just contract` prints its folder. Start with "What a great extension does" in its `extensions.md`, and open only the parts that it links

## Change a command

Build each command with the skill in `.agents/skills/nicely-extension/`, from the first command.
Its rounds give the order of the work, from the intake to "Done when".
Write the handler body on `sdk/wrap` for one program, or on `sdk/runner` for more.
Declare the command in the manifest and the catalog, so `extension.Check` passes.
Teach when to use the command in `skill/SKILL.md`.

Give each command one bounded job beneath the extension root.
Never relay arbitrary arguments to a wrapped program.
The skill teaches when to use the command, rather than its implementation.
For a command with a dry run, tell the agent to dry-run the call first.

Judge the primary output with a reader that is not the wrapped program. Do it in each acceptance case of `testdata/script/`, and in `acceptance.sh` on the real input.
A check that reads only a header or the file type is not sufficient.
Compare the content that this reader gives with an independent reference.
Use the real input and criteria of `## Acceptance`.
For a paid command, run only its dry run.

A wrapped script goes in `worker/`.

`sdk/wrap` keeps 1 MB of stdout, and answers `RUNTIME` once a program writes more. A program that prints its progress on stdout, such as an encoder, can pass that limit in a long run. When the decoder reads no stdout, set `DiscardStdout: true` in `wrap.Program`. When it reads stdout, set an `OutputLimit` that the longest run cannot pass. Prove it with a scenario whose stub prints more than 1 MB on stdout, then exits 0.

## Rule index

`AGENTS/rule-index.md` and its parts in `AGENTS/rule-index/` name the check that enforces each rule of this file. `just check` prints how many rules wait for a check.

## Recipes

The recipes need Go, `just`, and `uv`, which runs the pinned Copier of `just update`.
Most scenarios use shell stubs of HandBrakeCLI and ffmpeg. The made-media acceptance scenario needs real HandBrakeCLI, ffmpeg and ffprobe.
A real conversion needs HandBrakeCLI on PATH.
It also needs ffmpeg unless `--no-normalize` is set or the input has no audio.
Signoff also needs Git and `gh` with the `gh-signoff` extension.

After Copier creates the repository, run `go mod tidy` once, which writes `go.sum` for the recipes. Then commit the repository with Git, since `just update` needs a clean Git tree. Run `lefthook install` once per clone, so `just check` runs before each push. GitHub runs it again for each push to `main` and each pull request.

- `just check`: every check. It runs `go mod tidy -diff`, `gofmt`, `go vet`, the analyzers of the pinned SDK, and `go test`, whose test kit installs the extension into scratch folders. With `verification/tlc.json`, it first reads the record of its TLA+ models
- `just finish`: the exit of the loop. `finish-gate.md` in the pinned contract lists what it checks
- `just records`: writes `## Intake` of `vision.md` from `intake.toml`, and `readiness.md` from `review.toml`, as `build-records.md` in the pinned contract says
- `just verify-publication`: bounded publication model, Linux signal probes, and negative controls; refreshes the publication record
- `just verify-models [jar]`: optional. It checks the TLA+ models of `verification/tlc.json` with the pinned TLC and the Java of mise, then writes the record that `just check` reads. `formal-models.md` in the pinned contract says how
- `just scenario <name>`: runs the scenario `testdata/script/<name>.txtar`, such as the first scenario of round 1 at its commit
- `just signoff`: runs `just finish` and `just check` on the committed SHA in a detached scratch worktree. It also runs the first failing run of `review.toml` again, at its commit. Then it writes a receipt outside the repository, and signs that exact SHA
- `just install`: installs the extension into Nicely's extensions folder, in place of its previous install
- `just uninstall`: removes that install, and keeps its keys and grants
- `just acceptance [fixture]`: runs `acceptance.sh`, which runs the command of `## Acceptance` as an agent would. It runs in an owned run of the SDK, without the Nicely settings of the caller, such as `NCLY_CONFIG`. It works on a copy of the fixture, or on an input that it makes
- `just update <version>`: runs the target version's updater on a clean Git tree, with the template before the SDK
- `just contract`: prints the folder of the contract at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins

### Update an older repository

For a repository whose update recipe holds a script, run the target updater directly.
Replace VERSION with the target Nicely tag, such as `v0.24.0`:

```sh
go -C "$(go mod download -json github.com/pascalandy/nicely@VERSION | sed -n 's/^[[:space:]]*"Dir": "\(.*\)",$/\1/p')" run ./sdk/extensionrepo/cmd/extensionrepo update VERSION "$PWD"
```

The updater keeps your dependencies and reconciles Nicely's replacements in `go.mod`.
On a Copier conflict, resolve each file and mark it with `git add`.
Remove each `.rej` file, then run the printed bootstrap command with `--continue`.
This finishes dependency updates and runs `just check`.
`update-an-extension.md` of the contract holds the recovery rules.
After an update from a template before `just finish`, start the first build after the update commit, as the skill says.

## Done when

The rounds of the skill stop when all of these hold:

- `just finish` passes
- `just check` and `just acceptance` pass, and the hosted checks pass

A build has at most 5 rounds, and `just finish` fails after 5.
At that limit, stop, and report each open line and each open finding to the user, as the skill says.
An answer that lets you choose, such as "decide yourself", accepts no limit and starts no round.
For a command that needs a key, relay the grant hint to the human and wait.
A delivery skill or a merge gate, such as a "full stop" or "full send" request, runs after "Done when" holds.
It never replaces "Done when". `just signoff` runs `just finish` first, so a merge or a release waits until `just finish` passes. When the previous pull request is not merged, a new pull request stacks on its branch.

## Release

1. Commit every change
2. Push that commit to a review branch
3. Run `just signoff` for that pushed commit
4. Make sure that "Done when" holds for this commit
5. Merge that exact signed SHA into the default branch
6. Run `just release vX.Y.Z`, with an optional fixture path. It runs `just finish` again on that commit, then `just acceptance`, before it makes the tag
7. Read the printed receipt for acceptance, the published install, Economy reservations, hosted checks, and uninstall

For release recovery, read "Release and install" in the pinned contract's `extensions.md`.
