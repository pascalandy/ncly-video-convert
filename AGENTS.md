# AGENTS.md

`ncly-video-convert` adds commands at `ncly video convert` and beneath it.
The domain names a family of work, such as `video`.
An optional name identifies one job, such as `convert`.
Neither names the wrapped tool.
Read `extension-identity.md` in the pinned contract for the slug and command ownership.

## Read, in this order

1. `vision.md`: the job of the extension, what it wraps, and what it refuses
2. `spec.md`: what proves the success of each command, why each effect exists, and its failures
3. `qa.md`: how a user accepts the extension, with the UAT protocol of Nicely
4. `manifest.toml`: the machine facts of each command, which `ncly describe video convert --json` shows once the extension is installed
5. The contract, at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins. `just contract` prints its folder. Start with "What a great extension does" in its `extensions.md`, and open only the parts that it links

## Change a command

1. `spec.md`: its section, titled `## ncly <path>`, at the extension root or beneath it
2. `manifest.toml`: its declaration, with its effects, programs, keys, and result schema
3. `locales/en.toml`: its text, each entry with a description
4. Add a placeholder handler that compiles, and register it in `extension.go`
5. `testdata/script/`: its scenarios, which fail for the missing behavior. `test-kit.md` in the contract lists their commands. For a command with a dry run, give each refusal of the shared preparation a dry-run scenario with the same code
6. Write the handler body, on `sdk/wrap` for one program, or on `sdk/runner` for more
7. `skill/SKILL.md`: when to use the command, and when not to. For a command with a dry run, tell the agent to dry-run the call first

`extension.Check` must pass before a scenario can fail for the missing behavior. Steps 1 through 4 prepare that check.

A wrapped script goes in `worker/`. To take in a script, or to review the extension when the user asks, use the skill in `.agents/skills/nicely-extension/`.

`sdk/wrap` keeps 1 MB of stdout, and answers `RUNTIME` once a program writes more. A program that prints its progress on stdout, such as an encoder, can pass that limit in a long run. When the decoder reads no stdout, set `DiscardStdout: true` in `wrap.Program`. When it reads stdout, set an `OutputLimit` that the longest run cannot pass. Prove it with a scenario whose stub prints more than 1 MB on stdout, then exits 0.

## Recipes

The recipes need Go, `just`, and `uv`, which runs the pinned Copier of `just update`. Scenarios use a shell stub of HandBrakeCLI. A real conversion needs HandBrakeCLI on PATH.

After Copier creates the repository, run `go mod tidy` once, which writes `go.sum` for the recipes. Then commit the repository with Git, since `just update` needs a clean Git tree. Run `lefthook install` once per clone, so `just check` runs before each push. GitHub runs it again for each push to `main` and each pull request.

- `just check`: every check. It runs `go mod tidy -diff`, `gofmt`, `go vet`, and `go test`, whose test kit installs the extension into scratch folders
- `just install`: installs the extension into Nicely's extensions folder, in place of its previous install
- `just uninstall`: removes that install, and keeps its keys and grants
- `just acceptance [fixture]`: runs `acceptance.sh`, which runs the command of `## Acceptance` as an agent would, in scratch folders. It works on a copy of the fixture, or on an input that it makes
- `just update <version>`: moves the repository to another Nicely version, the template first and then the SDK, on a clean Git tree
- `just contract`: prints the folder of the contract at the Nicely version that `go.mod` pins

## Done when

`just check` passes, and `just acceptance` passes on the real input of `## Acceptance`. For a paid command, its dry run is enough. For a command that needs a key, relay the grant hint to the human and wait.

## Release

A user installs a fixed version from its tag, with the commands of `README.md`.
A release is one Git tag `vX.Y.Z` of Semantic Versioning, such as `v0.1.0`.
"Release and install" in the contract's `extensions.md` holds these rules.

1. Commit every change
2. Run `just check` on the clean Git tree
3. Make sure that "Done when" holds for this commit
4. Push the commit to the default branch of the remote repository
5. Tag that commit, such as with `git tag v0.1.0`
6. Push the tag, such as with `git push origin v0.1.0`
7. Run the commands of `README.md` for the new tag in a new folder. `ncly describe video convert --json` must describe `video convert`
