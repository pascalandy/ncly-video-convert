# Acceptance proof

This part of the [rule index](../rule-index.md) holds the acceptance rules of the build loop.

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Before the first review, a test file holds a block that a reader needs, with a value that is not the default and private text | [Kit `reads`][reads] needs private text unless an accepted limit describes retained data and its [privacy declaration][privacy-limits] applies. Each matrix Output case needs [a case][reads-matrix]. Round 1 runs `just check` before review. The reviewer judges the value and the limit's meaning |
| An independent reader proves the declared privacy behavior and that the content shows correctly. A handler that violates that rule fails | [Kit `reads`][reads] searches private text unless an [accepted privacy limit][privacy-limits] applies, and compares the full reference. A bad variant fails the declared check. For a private-text search, the bad variant holds the private text |
| The tests and `just acceptance` need no root, no mount, and no system service | Prose only |
| Each case of the Output group that applies has a test file that the tests make, checked by an independent reader | [Kit Output cases][reads-matrix] for each case that `## Case matrix` names; partial: the reviewer checks that the matrix names each case that applies |
| The tests make their files; never search the home folder or copy a file of the user | [Kit `reads`][reads] reads only files of the folder of the scenario; partial: no isolation of the system hides the files of the user |
| Round 1 tests each generic case that applies, and the first review tests families of cases | Prose on purpose: no manifest lists every family of a domain, so only the reviewer finds a missing one |
| Before the review of round 1, `## Case matrix` gives each family its tests, and each line of Failures and Acceptance a family | [Finish matrix][finish-matrix] checks the references only, not that the matrix is complete or correct |
